              <p className="lead my-3">
                In advanced autonomous systems, perception plays a critical role in understanding and interacting with the environment. By applying cutting-edge image processing methods, these systems can accurately interpret their surroundings. A variety of sensors, such as cameras, LiDAR, and radar, are employed to gather diverse data, which is then processed to create a precise and comprehensive representation of the environment. This enables the system to detect and track objects, identify obstacles, and make informed decisions in real-time. Accurate perception is key to ensuring smooth navigation and safety in complex, dynamic environments.

              <p className="lead my-3">
              Motion planning is a crucial stage that follows perception in robotics, where perceived data offers valuable insights into the system's surroundings. Once the environment is understood, the challenge becomes determining the feasibility of executing a maneuver. This involves assessing various factors such as obstacle locations, path constraints, and real-time dynamics like speed and direction. Advanced algorithms evaluate multiple potential trajectories, optimizing for factors like safety, efficiency, and smoothness. By continuously processing this data, the system can adapt its path in real-time, ensuring reliable navigation through dynamic environments while avoiding collisions and optimizing travel time.

              <p className="lead my-3">
              The controls subsystem serves as the crucial bridge between software and hardware, translating high-level decisions into precise physical actions. Its primary task is to ensure the system accurately follows the optimal path provided by the motion planning module. This involves controlling key parameters like velocity and steering to achieve smooth, efficient movement while maintaining safety. In doing so, it must account for the performance and limitations of electrical components, such as motors and actuators, ensuring they function harmoniously. Through continuous feedback loops, the subsystem adjusts to changes in real-time, ensuring the system remains on course, responsive to both internal commands and external environmental factors.

              The mechatronics subsystem integrates mechanics and electronics to enable seamless automation and enhance overall performance. A key focus is designing and implementing Drive-By-Wire (DBW) systems, which electronically control critical functions like throttle, brakes, and steering. These systems are powered by custom-designed PCBs, ensuring precision and reliability in operation. Additionally, the subsystem establishes and utilizes a Controller Area Network (CAN) to manage communication between various actuators and sensors. This network allows for real-time data exchange, enabling accurate control of the vehicle’s movements and ensuring efficient coordination of the system’s mechanical and electronic components.
